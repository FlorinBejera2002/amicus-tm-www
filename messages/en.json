    "description_p1_6": "We join our efforts and knowledge to witness the Gospel and extend the Kingdom of God worldwide, starting from Romania. Fulfilling God's desire (1 Timothy 2:4) is the mission of our association, motivated by God's love for us, and in turn, we do it for people (1 John 3:16).",
    "description_p3_1": "We aspire to see a growing movement of Christians who act for Christ and implement the principles of the Kingdom of God. We desire churches and believers to be dedicated to winning souls for God, restoring those who have fallen, and helping those with different problems for their spiritual growth. We do not intend to replace the mission of the Lord's Church but rather emphasize, motivate, and serve as a bridge for evangelizing people and serving believers.",

    "description_p6_1": "The salvation of the lost",
    "description_p6_2": "Love for the Lord Jesus Christ leads us to love people. Our goal is to see Him as the Lord and Savior of many people. His love has ignited a passion for people in us. The conviction that Jesus Christ is the only way of salvation drives us to use these methods to reach people's hearts. The importance of the family is a priority; therefore, our service focuses on families.",
    "description_p7_1": "Concrete action for Christ",
    "description_p7_2": "Faith is demonstrated through actions! We want to be influential, motivating, and contagious for believers in favor of the unchurched, those who have fallen away from faith, and those with various problems.",
    "description_p8_1": "Romanians for Romanians everywhere",
    "description_p8_2": "Like the Apostle Paul, our heart's desire and prayer to God is for Romanians to be saved (Romans 10:1, 11:13-14). We believe in a global vision that goes beyond the context of local and denominational church involvement and involves unity, diversity, and dedication to Christ's cause in the world. We support long-term or short-term missionary work in specific areas of the world.",
    "principals_p1_0": "Arise Working Principles",
    "principals_p1_1": "Our mission can be summarized in two words: salvation and action. Salvation for those who do not know Christ and mobilization of believers through concrete actions.",

    "principals_p4_2": "We want to be real, honest, humble, and separated from any religious forms, anchored in the truth of the Scriptures, which we communicate in love. Being authentic Christians in our context means that our actions are the best evidence of our authenticity.",
    "principals_p5_1": "Unity in collaboration",
    "principals_p5_2": "We constantly seek zonal and local collaborations with missions, missionaries, evangelists, churches, and collaborators with whom we serve together for the Kingdom.

    "principals_p6_1": "Arise Beliefs",
    "principals_p6_2": "We believe that the Bible, both the Old and New Testaments, is verbally inspired by God, inerrant in the original, unique, and the final authority in matters of faith, morality, and Christian practice.",
    "principals_p6_3": "We believe in one God, the Infinite and Perfect Spirit, existing from eternity in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the Creator of the entire universe.",
    "principals_p6_4": "We believe that Jesus Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, in His sinless life, being at the same time true God and true man.",
    "principals_p6_5": "We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures, as a representative and substitutionary sacrifice, and that all who believe and trust in Him are justified by His shed blood.",
    "principals_p6_6": "We believe in the bodily resurrection of our crucified Lord and in His Ascension to heaven, where He currently intercedes for us as Advocate and High Priest.",
    "principals_p6_7": "We believe that man was created by God in His image and was good and righteous; however, he sinned through his own choice by disobedience, coming out from under God's authority, and as a result, he suffered not only physical death but also spiritual death, i.e., separation from God; that all human beings are born with a sinful nature, and when they reach the age of moral responsibility, they become sinners in thought, speech, and deed.",
    "principals_p6_8": "We believe that all who receive the Lord Jesus Christ by faith as Lord and Savior are born again by the Holy Spirit and, as a result, become children of God.",
    "principals_p6_9": "We believe in the salvation from sin (the salvation of man) through God's grace, through man's repentance, and through water baptism as a result of the change worked by the Spirit through the Word of God.",
    "principals_p6_10": "We believe in the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, in the operation of spiritual gifts for the service of the Lord's Church and the unchurched world.",
    "principals_p6_11": "We believe in that \"blessed hope\": the imminent return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the rapture of the Church.",
